# UT-coding-Projects-
Projects completed individually and in teams for UT coding bootcamp
This is a repository specifically to house all of the work that I do during the UT coding bootcamp I attend. I will update these projects during the course of the class. This repositry will be meant to showcase my learning and how a progressed from novice to proficient. as such, I will try to keep updates in this repository limited to those specifically directed by the course work. I will have another repository for projects to showcase my updated and current skillset.

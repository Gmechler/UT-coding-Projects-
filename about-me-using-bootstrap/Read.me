This project has been very frustrating. I have spent aproximatly 16 hrs specifically tring to code this page and an additional 10 hrs this week doing other turotials and readings on bootstrap. I am clearly missing something because I find this infinatly more illogical and frustrating that writing my own css. The primary issues that I have run into are as follows. I do not seem to understand nesting of rows and columns. In my head it makes perfect sense and seams beautifully logical. However, the infuriating part is writing it out and checking the results in the browser and not understanding at all what is behaving the way that it is. my portfolio is a perfect example. Perhaps I am tired and frustrated and as a result not evaluating efficiently but i cannot explain why it is behaving the way it is. I have purchased a udemy course on bootsrap and ill be working through that as I find time so that I dont fall behing on JS. I will make improvements to this page as I gain a btter understanding. I also will make this assignment the first item that I discuse with my tutor.

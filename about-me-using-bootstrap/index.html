                  I am a recent graduate of the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp. When I made the decision to move into the tech field, I felt like it was a really big change from my former career. That is, until I started talking to some of my friends in the tech field. It was the different areas without ever receiving any kind of real training. I had written this experience off as being insignificant. It became apparent  almost immediately that my experience would be highly relevant.
                </p>
                <p> Throughout my career I have enjoyed complex problem solving. I worked as a Child Protective Services caseworker for many years for exactly this reason but I found that I was routinely frustrated by the lack of definitive solutions. I am excited to continue learning new and creative ways to solve problems because each time that I do, I can now do a little happy dance.
